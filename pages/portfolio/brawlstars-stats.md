## Statistical Analysis of the Brawl Stars Matchmaking Algorithm

The reality of all video games is they all need a monetization model. And among the thousands of garbage mobile games that all rely on ads or pay-to-win mechanics, Brawl Stars stands out with a much more enjoyable monetization model. Its big selling point is cosmetic items, more specifically, skins for your characters. 

Featured in the center of the image above is a character named Amber's new skin and I think it looks absolutely amazing. The only skin available that is nearly as good as this "Dark Knight" theme is an Elsa-inspired skin with an ice theme. However, this skin was being given away to everyone who could get nine wins in a challenge before losing their four lives. If you did end up losing all four lives, you could pay a small amount of in-game currency to get some extra tries to get you the rest of the way. Sounds fair, right? 

I ended up buying extra lives for this challenge far far far too many times. And I'm ticked about it. Ticked enough to write an expose on the matchmaking algorithm even though nobody has any idea what I'm talking about! 

Of course I'm not petty! Just tenacious ;)

During this challenge I played the game a lot more casually, meaning I was low rank compared to others playing the challenge. As I played, I felt like the matchmaking was rigged against me. It seemed like I was consistently being matched up against lower ranked players that just had no idea what to do. On the other hand, my opponents were frequently average to above-average rank, meaning they're capable of working effectively with a team, even if its a team of randoms they had never played with before this moment. 

Game after game after game after game this happened with me buying more and more tries. And I was getting really mad about it. Eventually I temporarily gave up on the challenge and grinded out ranked matches until I was the above-average rank. And what do you know? Matchmaking became substantially easier. Occasionally I was put against a team of equal skill to my own, but more often than not the teams seemed to be in my favor. 

It should be obvious why this form of matchmaking is bad for your average player who only occasionally picks up the game. It is the equivalent of showing up to a dodgeball match and allowing the best player to choose their entire team and leaving the rest to be crushed. All competition is lost at that point. It really sucks. But this makes sense if you are designing the monetization model for your game. The better players are your source of revenue, not the casuals. Even still, I think it's unfair, especially since I am committed to the game, just not ranked. 

So I did what any normal person would do. <s>Laugh it off and move on</s> Learn how to use the Brawl Stars API and make a webscraper to gather a dataset of 3000 games and dredge up old AP stats knowledge to prove I am not crazy!
