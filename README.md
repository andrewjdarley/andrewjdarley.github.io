This Repository is my take on creating a website with my limited web development experience. The idea is to primarily rely on file-structure and `.md` files that I am much more familiar with editing. This acts as a good template and I'm always updating the core html and javascript using AI to add the features I need. This repository contains my work but will also work as a template for anyone else who wants to make their own website without paying and with minimal web-dev experience. 

Please steal this repo if it suits you! I'd love to see it. Just make sure you give me a thumbs up too ;)
